### Database setup

> - The database (`countries-app`) of this application will be created

> - The local database URI (which was used in the project) is `mongodb://localhost:27017/countries-app`.
#### Run project

> - Run `npm run build` to build the application
> - Run `npm run dev` to start the server
> - Go to [http://localhost:5000/api/countries](http://localhost:5000/api/countries) to interact with
>   the graphql server api created by apollo and express.
> - If you want to play with code and see the live updates
>   go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
> - Everytime you make updates to the code and want to see the updates live
